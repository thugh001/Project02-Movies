# Flask OMDB Api

In this exercice we are playing with Flask and OMDB Api.

We've add some tests. One is red, you have to fix it.

To install the project. If you don't have **pip** :
`wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py && python get-pip.py`

After install the requirements, git clone the project and *cd* into it :

```python
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the test with `python format_name_test.py` run the website with `python flask_demo.py`.
